#### [Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity Model (GARCH)](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/StatisticalModels-Python/blob/main/GARCH%20Model.ipynb)
The GARCH model asserts that the best predictor of the variance in the next period is a weighted average of the long run average variance, the variance predicted for this period and the new information this period which is the most recent squared residual.
